## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS

To create this template site based on the design image given to me, I used multiple sections. I used float to have the sections stack on each other the way I wanted. The styling of this webpage was pretty straight-forward. I used divs to create the background images as placeholders for when the client wants to place images in the site. Finally I used media queries to make the site responsive from the largest screen to the smallest screen.


## Lessons Learned

In this project, I learned how to widen the space between buttons and their borders in a more efficient way. I also learned about the proper content decisions to make for a site witht his kind of layout.
